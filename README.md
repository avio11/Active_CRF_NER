# Active_NER
Active learning based algorithm for named entity recognition using CRF model on CoNLL03 dataset.

At first the code is presented as an ipython notebook, which should later be converted into python files for ease of use for different datasets.

Sampling strategies implemented thus far:

1) Uncertainty-based
  - Least confidence
  - Margin confidence (Coming soon!!)
  - Entropy (Coming soon!!)
  
2) Random sampling (used as a comparative baseline)
